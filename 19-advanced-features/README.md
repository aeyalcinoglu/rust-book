# Unsafe Rust
- Unsafe Rust exists because, by nature, static analysis is conservative.
- Another reason Rust has an unsafe alter ego is that the underlying computer hardware is inherently unsafe.
- There are 5 *unsafe superpowers*:
	- Dereference a raw pointer
	- Call an unsafe function or method
	- Access or modify a mutable static variable
	- Implement an unsafe trait
	- Access fields of `union`s
- To interact with code written in another language, Rust has a keyword, `extern`, that facilitates the creation and use of a *Foreign Function Interface (FFI)*.
- Difference between constants and immutable static variables is that values in a static variable have a fixed address in memory.
- Accessing and modifying mutable static variables is *unsafe*.
- See [the reference on union](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/items/unions.html).
- Using `unsafe` to take one of the five actions (superpowers) just discussed isnâ€™t wrong or even frowned upon, but it is trickier.
