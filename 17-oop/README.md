# OOP
- Objects came from [Simula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula) in the 1960s.
- [Bible of OOP, GoF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
- Rust doesn't have inheritance. However, default implementations of methods on traits can be used. For polymorphism, Rust has trait objects and generics.
